In this assignment I used blueprints to create a 24hr clock that displays the current time using the on tick node in UE4 blueprints and
the now node to get the time from my computer.

I also created a guessing game that uses branches and keyboard presses to function and worked with Marc to use the restart game node using
the game mode blueprint (NOT GAME MODE BASE).
